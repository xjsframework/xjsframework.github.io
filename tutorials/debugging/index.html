<h1>Debugging Your Plugins</h1>
<div class="notice"><strong>Important Notice:</strong> Google Chrome removed support for remote debugging starting from Chrome 50. For developers who updated to the said version or higher, you may use the following alternatives:
	<ul>
		<li>load the remote debugging discovery page as an extension in XBC; or</li>
		<li>download an independent CEF build <a href="http://cdn2.xsplit.com/xjs/download/cef-build/cef_binary_3.2704.1434.gec3e9ed_windows32_client.7z" target="_blank">cef version</a> and use it to load the remote debugging discovery page.
		(This CEF build is Chromium 49)</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p>
	XSplit Broadcaster allows you to debug your pages by exposing the DevTools.
	You can do this in two ways, first is to set it on the Settings window for XBC
	or add a startup parameter on your XBC shortcut.
</p>
<p>
	Changing it through Settings, open the settings window through Tools > Settings.
	At the Settings window, click the Advanced tab, then check <strong>Enable developer mode</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	XSplit Broadcaster would need to restart to apply the changes.
	After, you can then just open <code>http://localhost:9222</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Alternatively, if you want to select a specific port, setting a startup parameter is also acceptable.
	To do this, create a shortcut to <code>XSplit.Core.exe</code>,
	and right-click to open the properties window to add the startup parameter:
	<code>remotedebug:<em>&lt;port&gt;</em></code>.
	The default is port 9222, but you can use your preferred port
	(just ensure that no other process is also using it.)
</p>

<p>Once this is done, simply open <code>http://localhost:<em>&lt;port&gt;</em></code> (the remote debugging discovery page) on your browser. You will see a list of links, each pertaining to a plugin/webpage URL and labeled through their <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, or if not present, their URL. Click the link pertaining to your plugin to begin debugging. Note that this is not just for sources, but for extensions as well!</p>

<h2>Debugging Your Source Properties Window</h2>
<p>Debugging the source properties window is a bit tricky. To do this, you would need to download the <code>xsplitprops.html</code> file <a href = "http://cdn2.xsplit.com/xjs/download/xsplitprops.html" target="_blank" download>here</a> and move it to the same folder where <code>XSplit.Core.exe</code> is located. This is a special build for debugging.</p>

<p>After this, you would need to add the startup parameter to XSplit: <code>enablehtmlprop:2</code>.</p>

<p>You will now then be able to see the <code>XBC Source Properties_debugger</code> item on the remote debugging page, together with your plugins. Click on this link and you can start debugging the source property window you wrote.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong><i>The XBC Source Properties_debugger will allow you to debug the source properties of the source that was last right-clicked. With that said, make sure that you open your plugin's source properties first before debugging XBC Source Properties_debugger.</i></p>
