<h1>Developing Source Properties Windows</h1>
<p>
  The properties window is a very important tool to allow customization of your source plugin. This article details how to use the framework to layout the window, and to allow the window access to the source's custom configuration object. Developers begin by creating HTML for the properties window's graphical interface.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
  <p>
    Before you can begin on creating and designing the Source Properties Window,
    the items listed here should first be met. Missing one or more of these requiremts
    would cause the Source Properties to not load properly.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Source Plugin that you are developing this Source Properties should have
      <strong>xjs</strong> imported in it and <code>xjs.ready()</code> has been called
    </li>
    <li>
      The Source Plugin should the meta tag below:
      <pre class="language-html">
      <code>&lt;meta name="xsplit:config-url" content="./config.html"&gt;</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      The same with it's Source Plugin, your Source Properties should have <strong>xjs</strong>
      imported and <code>xjs.ready()</code> called.
    </li>
    <li>
      Source Properties should have it's instance be set to
      <strong>useTabbedWindow</strong> or <strong>useFullWindow</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Properties window layouts</h3>
<p>
  The framework allows developers two different layout schemes for the properties window. The first is called tabbed mode, which allows users to leverage XSplit's existing tab system, and even to reuse a number of existing core tabs. The second is called full mode, which gives the developers total control over the full space of the window (the title bar and the Keep Source in Memory checkbox is already supplied).
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// within your config HTML
var xjs = require('xjs');
var propsWindow = xjs.SourcePropsWindow.getInstance();

// Option 1: Use XSplit's existing tab system
xjs.ready()
  .then(function() {
    propsWindow.useTabbedWindow({
      customTabs: ['Custom'],
      // Layout/Color/Transition are optional reusable XSplit tabs
      tabOrder: ['Custom', 'Layout', 'Color', 'Transition']
    });
  });

// Option 2: Use the full window
xjs.ready()
  .then(function() {
    propsWindow.useFullWindow();
  });</code></pre>
<p>
  The following images illustrate the difference between the two modes as specified by the above code snippets. Right-clicking the video item (yellow) opens the properties window. The blue area indicates where the developer's own HTML will be rendered. You can see tabbed mode on the left, and full mode on the right.

<h3>Tabbed Mode</h3>
<p>This section only applies to those who prefer to use XSplit's existing tab system (option 2 in the code snippet above).</p>
<p>
  In tabbed mode, source properties windows are allowed to reuse the functionality of three of the existing tabs. These are: Layout, Color, Transition. Developers also have the capability to use their own custom tabs. In the above example, only one custom tab is used, and it is given the name "Custom". The above example also illustrates that the plugin also wishes to reuse all three of the reusable tabs, by specifying them in the <code>tabOrder</code> node of the JSON object. Note that both the <code>customTabs</code> and <code>tabOrder</code> nodes are required to make tabbed mode work.
</p>
<p>
  Developers should also note that since there is only one HTML file for their properties window, multiple custom tabs have to be handled in the same file. In order to achieve this, the window needs to listen to the <code>set-selected-tab</code> event emitted by the properties window's event emitter. (This event only fires when a custom tab is selected.)
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>var propsWindow = xjs.SourcePropsWindow.getInstance();
propsWindow.on('set-selected-tab', function(selectedTab) {
  // selectedTab is the exact tab title passed to the customTabs node
  // Plugin developers should let the page render the correct tab here, perhaps through CSS
});</code></pre>
<a name="man-config-obj"><h3>Manipulating the configuration object</h3></a>
<p>
  The source’s custom configuration object can be manipulated similarly to how the source itself does it (<a href="tutorials.html#/sourceplugins" target="_blank">see this article</a>), but there are some differences.
</p>
<p>
  When the framework is ready, the source properties window doesn't need to apply any saved settings to the source. It only needs to concern itself to update its settings UI to display the last saved settings. This is done in exactly the same manner as is done in the source itself.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>var xjs = require('xjs');
var Source = xjs.Source;

xjs.ready()
  .then(Source.getCurrentSource)
  .then(function(mySource) {
    return mySource.loadConfig();
  }).then(function(config) {
    // update any checkboxes/inputs/etc. in source properties window
    // to display last saved configuration
  });</code></pre>
<p>
  When manipulating the configuration object, the main difference is in saving the configuration: because of the underlying architecture, the properties window is only allowed to signal or request the source to save the configuration itself. It is still the source's responsibility to actually save the configuration. The following code snippet illustrates this.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// config.html
mySaveButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // this sends the 'save-config' event to the source's window
  mySource.requestSaveConfig(configObj);
});</code></pre>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// source.html
var xjs = require('xjs');
var sourceWindow = xjs.SourcePluginWindow.getInstance();

sourceWindow.on('save-config', function(configObj) {
  mySource.saveConfig(configObj);
});</code></pre>
<p>
  There may be some cases when the plugin may need to change some settings without the need for saving the configuration object. This can be useful in such cases as allowing a "preview" of the changes when hovering over a color swatch. Sample code below:
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// config.html
myPropertyChanger.addEventListener('click', function() {
  mySource.applyConfig(configObj); // does not ask to save
});</code></pre>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// source.html
var myDiv = document.getElementById('myDiv');

sourceWindow.on('apply-config', function(configObj) {
  if (configObj.hasOwnProperty('text')) {
    myDiv.textContent = configObj.text;
  }
});</code></pre>
<p>
  Although the above two methods are made available to developers, in practice, most plugins will simply call both <code>applyConfig</code> and <code>requestSaveConfig</code> in the same code for handling any changes to the configuration object. Developers will also have separate logic for the <code>apply-config</code> and <code>save-config</code> events.
</p>
