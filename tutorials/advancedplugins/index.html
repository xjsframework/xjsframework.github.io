<h1>Creating Advanced Plugins</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  After the introduction to plugins in the Developing Sources and Developing Extensions sections,
  this tutorial shows some techniques for creating more powerful plugins.
</p>
<p>
  Plugins can make creative use of the xjs API, utilize any DLLs that ship with XSplit
  (or developed by you!), or even incorporating the API of other services.
  What we can give you here are some ways and ideas that you may use in
  developing your own special plugin.
</p>

<h2>Orchestrating Your Stream</h2>
<p>
  Our API is continuously being updated and improved to accommodate the new
  features and the growing needs of developers. If you still haven't checked our
  <a href="api.html">API documentation</a>, you should definitely do so to have a general idea
  of how the framework works.
</p>
<p>
  A creative way to utilize our API is to combine them to create a whole system
  that would control the entire flow of your stream. For example, when the stream
  starts, a video source begins to play. Then you can set it up so that when the
  video is done playing, it would switch to your next scene.
</p>
<p>
  This is a proof-of-concept <b>Extension Plugin</b> that accomplishes the above.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>let video;

xjs.Scene.getActiveScene()
.then(function(scene) { return scene.getItems(); })
.then(function(items) {
  for (var item in items) {
    if (items[item] instanceof MediaItem) {
      video = items[item];
    }
  }
});</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This code is a simple way to get the video source from the current scene (under
  the assumption that there is exactly one video). This source should be located
  in the scene you wish to use as your Intro scene for your stream.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start', function(start) {
  video.getPlaybackDuration().then(function(time) {
    // Set a timeout that would change the active scene
    // to desired scene after video plays.
    setTimeout(function() {
      xjs.Scene.setActiveScene(2); // the next scene in your program flow
    }, time / 1000); // time is in seconds

    // Ensure video would begin from the start before playing
    video.setPlaybackPosition(0);
    video.setPlaying(true);
  });
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The above code creates an function that would listen for the <code>stream-start</code> event;
  once the stream begins, the video starts playing from the beginning, and a scene
  change is triggered when the video is done. As an alternative option, you could
  set an additional delay as to the scene change timer, and keep your video on loop. This
  would be most helpful if you're still waiting for people to join your stream.
</p>
<p>
  That's the idea behind a plugin that orchestrates your stream! You can add
  more features to this extension plugin as well, such as stream controls,
  scene switching controls, a display of stream data, or even some source controls.
  You can let this extension occupy a second monitor so you can control your
  stream from there.
</p>
<h2>DLL Utilization</h2>
<p>
  More advanced plugins could require low-level functions that operate on the system
  itself, which is where DLLs can come in handy.
</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
  If you are interested in creating a DLL for your plugin, you would need to
  first implement the XSplit plugin interface, implement
  some functions in global namespace, and define <code>IXSplitScriptDllContext</code>.
</p>
<p>The following functions must be implemented in global namespace:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
BOOL WINAPI XSplitScriptPluginInit();
BOOL WINAPI XSplitScriptPluginCall(IXSplitScriptDllContext * pContext, BSTR
functionName, BSTR * argumentsArray, UINT argumentsCount, BSTR * returnValue);
void WINAPI XSplitScriptPluginDestroy();</code>
</pre>
<p>Define <code>IXSplitScriptDllContext</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
[uuid("9A554D8A-912F-4F1E-9A26-CC002B3B99BD")]
DECLARE_INTERFACE_(IXSplitScriptDllContext, IUnknown)
{
    STDMETHOD(Callback)(BSTRfunctionName, BSTR * argumentsArray, UINT argumentsCount) PURE;
};</code>
</pre>
<p>
  For the full document and guide on creating your DLL for XSplitBroadcaster please see <a href="assets/WritingcustomXSplitscriptDLLsinC.pdf">this document.</a>
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
  After loading them into your plugin through <a href="api.html#/core/Dll"><code>Dll.load()</code></a>, you can start using the DLLs.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var dll = xjs.Dll;
dll.load(['Scriptdlls\\SplitMediaLabs\\dllA.dll','Scriptdlls\\SplitMediaLabs\\dllB.dll']);

dll.call('xsplit.EnumProcesses').then(function(value) { console.log(value); });
// sample return value: "0,4,456,608,724,856,864,940,972,620,1012"</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The full information and detailed guide regarding the creation and use of DLL can be checked
  at <a href="tutorials.html#/dll">Using DLLs for Extensibility</a> tutorials page. That tutorial
  also documents the existing DLL functions that are already exposed for developers.
</p>

<h2>Other Services API</h2>
<p>
  Other than the use of our API and DLLs, you can also use other services API in developing
  your own plugin. These extenral services can be used to display relevant data on the stage,
  the most common example of this kind of services are chat and alerts, which streamers are
  very familiar with.
</p>
<p>
  Though we've already provided some plugins that does this for the more
  famous platforms, there may still be other sources that you might want to handle and create
  for your own.
</p>
<h3>Authorization</h3>
<p>
  Each service has their own Authorization process, which can be handled in different ways.
  For example Facebook and Twitch:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> requires you to include a short piece of
  JavaScript in your HTML that will load the basic Facebook SDK on your page:
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
  FB.init({
    appId      : 'your-app-id',
    xfbml      : true,
    version    : 'v2.9'
  });
  FB.AppEvents.logPageView();
};

(function(d, s, id){
    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}
    js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
    js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js";
    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
  }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</code>
</pre>
<p>
  While <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/" target="_blank"><strong>Twitch</strong></a> authentication involves 3 things.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/guides/authentication/#registration" target="_blank">Registering your app</a> to obtain a client ID and client secret.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/guides/authentication/#getting-access-tokens" target="_blank">Getting an access token</a>. This includes specifying scopes, or the permissions your app requires.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/guides/authentication/#sending-access-tokens" target="_blank">Sending the access token</a> in your API request, to authenticate API requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These two are just examples of how you can make use and authorize other services API into your
  plugin. Which is why it's important to know if the service you want to create a plugin with has
  guides and tutorial on how you can make use of their service.
</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>
  After having access to these API services, you can now make use of the data that is made available to
  you from these services and include them to your plugins.
</p>

<hr />
<p>
  The ones listed above are not the only ways you can create some more advanced plugins. You can incorporate
  other modules that you may be using and create a way for them to communicate or pass the information around.
